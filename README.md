- __F04 Footer__

    - The footer is featured on all three pages and is identical on each page making it easy to use.  It contains three sections :

        - Opening Times - having the opening times in the footer on each page allows the user to quickly and easily find this information, this is important for this type of business as it is information that the user needs in order to make use of the company (product is sold offline).

        - Address - similar to the opening times, the address of this type of business is important to the user in order for them to use the company and so has been repeated on each page in the footer to allow the user to quickly and easily find out where the company is located 

        - Stay in Touch - this area has links to social media sites associated with the organisation encouraging the user to keep connected.  The links will open in a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user. The organisation can use these sites to promote brand awareness and keep customers interested through updates, offers, chats and other marketing efforts. (As THRIVE is a ficticious company, the links currently just go to the social media main websites.)

- __F07 Contact Page - 'Contact Us'__

    - The 'Contact Us' panel of the Contact page allows the user to send a message/give feedback to the company and if they want, sign up to the company mailing list to get discount codes and offers.  The user is asked to provide their name and email address when sending a message. By default, the option to join the mailing list is set to 'no' - to prevent them accidentally signing up for the mailing list and getting unwanted email. Sending the message will result in a new tab showing the results (at the moment the user is simply shown the formdump.codeinstitute.net page with the data they submitted displayed)



- __F08 Contact Page - 'How to Find Us'__

    - The 'How to Find Us' panel of the Contact page gives the user an interactive google map showing the location of the company along with details on full address, phone number and administration email address in large font to make it easily readable.  By clicking the 'View larger map' link the user can go to the google maps site for the address - this opens in a separate tab to allow ease of navigation.

### Features which could be implemented in the future

- __Navigation bar improvements__
    - The functionality of the navigation bar could be extended to make it "sticky" so that it would be available to the user without scrolling.
