- __F03 Company Ideals section__

  - The Chess Society opening times and what lesson are on are displayed cards on the main page.  These cards give the user more information about when specific classes are on and with open play all level are welcome.

- __F04 Footer__

  - The footer is featured on all pages and is identical on each page making it easy to use.

    - Opening Times - having the opening times in the footer of the home page give easy access to see when classes are and when the area is available for games.

    - Stay in Touch - this area has links to social media sites associated with the organisation encouraging the user to keep connected.  The links will open in a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user. The organisation can use these sites to promote brand awareness and keep customers interested through updates, offers, chats and other marketing efforts. (As the Chess Society is a ficticious club, the links currently just go to the social media main websites.)

- __F07 Contact Page - 'Contact Us'__

  - The 'Contact Us' panel of the Contact page allows the user to send a message/give feedback to the company and if they want, sign up to the company mailing list to get discount codes and offers.  The user is asked to provide their name and email address when sending a message. By default, the option to join the mailing list is set to 'no' - to prevent them accidentally signing up for the mailing list and getting unwanted email. Sending the message will result in being directed to a page saying that someone will be in contact soon and you will be redirected back to the home page.

![Contact](documentation/contact-page.jpg)

- The 'Contact Us' page was tested with the "formdump.codeinstitute.net" page with the data they submitted displayed.

## Design

### Fonts

The fonts chosen for the website were Anton for headings and Commissioner for the main bodies of text on the website. Each of these were imported using [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). Sans-serif was chosen as the back-up font - in case these fonts don't load - because of it's clear readability. Font Arvo was used.

### Acknowledgments

- Thank you to my mentor Elaine Roche who went out of her way to help to with points and tips and gave me very good advice and feedback on how to plan and execute this project and who provided me with lots of pointers on resources to help select colours and images and well as resources to help with coding and testing.
