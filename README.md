- __Company Ideals section__

  * The Chess Society opening times and what lesson are on are displayed cards on the main page.  These cards give the user more information about when specific classes are on and with open play all level are welcome.

- __Footer__

  * The footer is featured on all pages and is identical on each page making it easy to use.

    * Opening Times - having the opening times in the footer of the home page give easy access to see when classes are and when the area is available for games.

    * Stay in Touch - this area has links to social media sites associated with the organisation encouraging the user to keep connected.  The links will open in a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user. The organisation can use these sites to promote brand awareness and keep customers interested through updates, offers, chats and other marketing efforts. (As the Chess Society is a ficticious club, the links currently just go to the social media main websites.)

- __Contact Page - 'Contact Us'__

  * The 'Contact Us' panel of the Contact page allows the user to send a message/give feedback to the company and if they want, sign up to the company mailing list to get discount codes and offers.  The user is asked to provide their name and email address when sending a message. By default, the option to join the mailing list is set to 'no' - to prevent them accidentally signing up for the mailing list and getting unwanted email. Sending the message will result in being directed to a page saying that someone will be in contact soon and you will be redirected back to the home page.

![Contact](documentation/contact-page.jpg)

* The 'Contact Us' page was tested with the "formdump.codeinstitute.net" page with the data they submitted displayed.

- __Contact Page - 'How to Find Us'__

  * The 'How to Find Us' panel of the Contact page gives the user an interactive google map showing the location of the company along with details on full address, phone number and administration email address in large font to make it easily readable.  By clicking the 'View larger map' link the user can go to the google maps site for the address - this opens in a separate tab to allow ease of navigation.

### Features which could be implemented in the future



## Design

### Colour Scheme

[Colormind.io](http://colormind.io/) was used to generate the colorscheme for this website.
 ![Navbar](documentation/color-pal.jpg)

### Fonts

The fonts chosen for the website were Anton for headings and Commissioner for the main bodies of text on the website. Each of these were imported using [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). Sans-serif was chosen as the back-up font - in case these fonts don't load - because of it's clear readability. Font Arvo was used.
