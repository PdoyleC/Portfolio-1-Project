The links will open in a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user. The organisation can use these sites to promote brand awareness and keep customers interested through updates, offers, chats and other marketing efforts. (As the Chess Society is a ficticious club, the links currently just go to the social media main websites.)

      


- __F07 Contact Page - 'Contact Us'__

    - The 'Contact Us' panel of the Contact page allows the user to send a message/give feedback to the company and if they want, sign up to the company mailing list to get discount codes and offers.  The user is asked to provide their name and email address when sending a message. By default, the option to join the mailing list is set to 'no' - to prevent them accidentally signing up for the mailing list and getting unwanted email. Sending the message will result in being directed to a page saying that someone will be in contact soon and you will be redirected back to the home page.

## Design

### Colour Scheme
[Colormind.io](http://colormind.io/) was used to generate the colorscheme for this website.

 ### Fonts
The fonts chosen for the website were Anton for headings and Commissioner for the main bodies of text on the website. Each of these were imported using [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). Sans-serif was chosen as the back-up font - in case these fonts don't load - because of it's clear readability. Font Arvo was used.
